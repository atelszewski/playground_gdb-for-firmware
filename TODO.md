- Add uC side code to talk with the PC over UART. For the moment, _main.c_ contains some rubbish.

- Extend section with more details, especially for _GDB_ and _OpenOCD_
- Add section on emulating and debugging using _QEMU_
- _Makefile_ has an extensive list of _TODO_ items to be taken care of.
  Scroll to the end of the _Makefile_ for the juice.
